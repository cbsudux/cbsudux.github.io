I'm a Deep Learning Research Engineer at [ViGIL Lab](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/vigil/doku.php) in [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/), advised by [Dr. Arjun Jain](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ajain/). I primarily work in Computer Vision and Deep Learning. I currently work on 3D human pose estimation.

Previously, I've had the opportunity to work at [HyperVerge](http://hyperverge.co/) and [NEST Lab](https://www.nestlab.net/doku.php/start).
